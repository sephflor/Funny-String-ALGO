# Funny-String-ALGO.This implementation checks if the absolute differences between adjacent characters in the original string match the absolute differences between adjacent characters in the reversed string, returning "Funny" if all differences match and "Not Funny" otherwise, efficiently solving the problem in O(n) time complexity.
